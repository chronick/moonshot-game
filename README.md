# Journey to the Moon

This is a submission for the Github Game Off 2020 on itch.io: https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020

## Developer's Note

The original release of this game was made in a month for the Jam. Admittedly theres a lot more we wanted to do
We wish we could have done more with this but wanted to ship a complete game even if there's not much to it.

This is the first complete game we've made together, and we learned an awful lot. We plan on doing more game jams in the future!

## Overview

This is intended to be an Oregon Trail-style game in space. 
The objective is to make it to the destination (a moon) with the ship intact. 
Along the way there will be various hazards that will pop up.
Some happen randomly and there's nothing you can do about it.
Some will launch a minigame that will give you more control over your fate.
